# BRD Generator

Generate a comprehensive Business Requirements Document following the standardized BRD schema.

## When to use

- Starting a new project and need to articulate business justification
- Translating business goals into a formal requirements document
- Need stakeholder alignment on scope, ROI, and timelines
- **Not** for technical design (use `trd-gen`) or product features (use `prd-gen`)
- **Complements** `idea-to-spec`: BRD focuses on business case; idea-to-spec explores product shape through dialogue

## Inputs

- **Required**:
  - `project_description`: What the project is about (text or existing document)
- **Optional**:
  - `stakeholders`: Known stakeholders and their roles
  - `budget_context`: Budget range or constraints
  - `timeline_context`: Desired timeline or deadlines
  - `existing_docs`: Related documents (market research, competitor analysis)

## Conventions

Follow `skills/product-dev/_shared/gen-conventions.md` for standard workflow, failure handling, and safety boundaries.

- **Schema**: `skills/product-dev/_shared/doc-schemas/brd-schema.md`
- **Metadata**: `type: BRD`, version `1.0.0`, status `Draft`
- **Naming**: `brd-<project-name>-v1.0.0.md`

## Workflow Details

Clarifying questions (if input is thin): problem statement, target users, business objectives, known constraints, success criteria.

Generate all required sections per the schema:
- Executive Summary
- Background & Problem Statement (with quantifiable evidence)
- SMART Business Objectives
- Stakeholder Analysis table
- Scope (In/Out)
- High-level Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- ROI & Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Risk Assessment (≥ 3 risks with mitigations)
- Timeline & Milestones (≥ 3 milestones)
- Success Criteria

**BRD-specific failure handling**:
- ROI cannot be estimated → include "ROI: Requires further analysis" with a list of data points needed
- Stakeholders unknown → use generic roles (Product Owner, Engineering Lead, etc.) and mark `[ASSUMED]`

## Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce checkout redesign

**User**: Create a BRD for redesigning our checkout flow. We're losing 40% of users at payment step. Target: reduce cart abandonment by 25% in Q2.
