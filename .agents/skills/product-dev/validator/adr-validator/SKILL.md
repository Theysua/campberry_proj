## ADR-Specific Checks

| Check | Severity | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| Valid status | CRITICAL | Must be Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded |
| Context forces | CRITICAL | Must describe at least 1 technical and 1 business force |
| Decision clarity | CRITICAL | Must be unambiguous "We will..." statement |
| Consequences balance | CRITICAL | At least 1 positive and 1 negative consequence |
| Alternatives | CRITICAL | ≥ 2 alternatives with pros, cons, rejection reason |
| Superseded reference | WARNING | If Superseded, must reference the superseding ADR |
