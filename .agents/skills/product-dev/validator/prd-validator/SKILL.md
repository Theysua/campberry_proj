# PRD Validator

Validate a PRD document against the standardized schema and quality rules.

## When to use

- PRD draft ready for quality review
- Before handing off PRD to engineering
- After `prd-iteration` to verify improvements
- **Read-only** — never modifies the document

## Inputs

- **Required**:
  - `prd_document`: The PRD to validate (file path or inline content)
- **Optional**:
  - `strict_mode`: Treat warnings as errors (default: false)
  - `related_brd`: BRD to cross-check alignment

## Conventions

Follow `skills/product-dev/_shared/validator-conventions.md` for standard workflow, output format, failure handling, and safety boundaries.

- **Schema**: `skills/product-dev/_shared/doc-schemas/prd-schema.md`
- **Cross-check**: If BRD provided, verify all BRD objectives map to PRD features.

## PRD-Specific Checks

| Check | Severity | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| P0 acceptance criteria | CRITICAL | Every P0 user story/requirement must have testable AC |
| User persona | CRITICAL | At least 1 persona with needs and pain points |
| Primary user flow | CRITICAL | At least 1 documented user flow |
| Non-goals | WARNING | Must list at least 1 non-goal |
| NFR metrics | WARNING | NFRs must have numeric targets |
| Open questions | WARNING | Should have owners and deadlines |
| BRD alignment | WARNING | If BRD provided, all BRD objectives must map to PRD features |


## Examples

### Example 1

**User**: Review this PRD for quality.

**Expected Output**: Validation report with scores, critical issues (e.g., "US-03 missing acceptance criteria"), warnings, and suggestions.
