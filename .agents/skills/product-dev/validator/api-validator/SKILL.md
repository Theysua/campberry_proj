# API Documentation Validator

Validate API documentation against the standardized schema and quality rules.

## When to use

- API docs written and need quality check
- Before publishing API reference
- After updating API docs to verify no regressions
- **Read-only** — never modifies the document

## Inputs

- **Required**:
  - `api_document`: The API documentation to validate
- **Optional**:
  - `code_source`: Source code to cross-check endpoint coverage

## Conventions

Follow `skills/product-dev/_shared/validator-conventions.md` for standard workflow, output format, failure handling, and safety boundaries.

- **Schema**: `skills/product-dev/_shared/doc-schemas/api-schema.md`
- **Cross-check**: If source code provided, verify all routes are documented.

## API-Specific Checks

| Check | Severity | Rule |
|-------|----------|------|
| Auth section | CRITICAL | Must include auth method and example header |
| Endpoint completeness | CRITICAL | Each endpoint must have method, path, ≥ 1 response |
| Error codes | CRITICAL | Each endpoint must document error responses |
| Request/response schemas | WARNING | Should have typed field definitions |
| Working example | WARNING | At least 1 complete curl example |
| Model definitions | WARNING | All referenced models must be defined |
| Code coverage | WARNING | If code provided, all routes must be documented |


## Examples

### Example 1

**User**: Validate our API documentation.

**Expected Output**: Validation report. Example: "CRITICAL: POST /users endpoint missing error response codes", "WARNING: No curl example provided".
