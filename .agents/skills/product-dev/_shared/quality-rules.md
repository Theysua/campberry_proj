# Quality Rules & Scoring System

> Shared quality framework referenced by all validator and gen skills.

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Completeness (权重: 30%)

All required sections present with substantive content.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | All required sections present and fully populated |
| 4 | All required sections present; 1-2 have minor gaps |
| 3 | 1-2 required sections missing or mostly empty |
| 2 | 3+ required sections missing |
| 1 | Document is a skeleton with minimal content |

### 2. Consistency (权重: 25%)

Terminology, formatting, and cross-references are internally consistent.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Uniform terminology; all IDs/refs resolve; no contradictions |
| 4 | Minor terminology inconsistency (1-2 instances) |
| 3 | Noticeable inconsistencies; some broken cross-references |
| 2 | Frequent contradictions or unresolved references |
| 1 | Document sections appear disconnected |

### 3. Clarity (权重: 25%)

Content is unambiguous and understandable by the target audience.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clear, concise; no jargon without definition; actionable |
| 4 | Mostly clear; 1-2 ambiguous statements |
| 3 | Several vague or overly abstract sections |
| 2 | Significant portions unclear or full of undefined jargon |
| 1 | Largely incomprehensible or purely aspirational |

### 4. Testability (权重: 20%)

Requirements and criteria can be objectively verified.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | All P0 items have measurable acceptance criteria |
| 4 | Most P0 items testable; 1-2 lack clear metrics |
| 3 | Mixed — some testable, some vague ("should be fast") |
| 2 | Most requirements lack measurable criteria |
| 1 | No testable criteria anywhere |

## Overall Score Calculation

```
Overall = Completeness × 0.30 + Consistency × 0.25 + Clarity × 0.25 + Testability × 0.20
```

## Verdict Thresholds

| Overall Score | Status | Meaning |

| ≥ 4.0 | **PASS** | Ready for review/approval |
| 2.5 – 3.9 | **NEEDS_WORK** | Requires revisions before proceeding |
| < 2.5 | **FAIL** | Major rework needed |
