# PRD Iteration

Apply changes to an existing PRD while maintaining version history and quality standards.

## When to use

- PRD validator reported issues that need fixing
- Stakeholder feedback requires PRD updates
- Scope changes or new requirements to incorporate
- **Not for** creating a new PRD from scratch (use `prd-gen`)

## Inputs

- **Required**:
  - `prd_document`: The existing PRD to update (file path or inline)
  - `change_request`: One of:
    - Validator report from `prd-validator`
    - Free-text change description
    - Structured change list
- **Optional**:
  - `preserve_sections`: Sections to not modify (default: none)

## Workflow

1. **Read current document**: Parse existing PRD, extract version metadata.

2. **Analyze changes**: Classify the change request:
   - Fix validation issues (CRITICAL first, then WARNING)
   - Apply content changes (additions, modifications, removals)
   - Scope changes (may require MAJOR version bump)

3. **Apply changes**: Modify affected sections while preserving unchanged content.

4. **Bump version**: Per `skills/product-dev/_shared/output-conventions.md`:
   - Typo/formatting → PATCH
   - New/updated content → MINOR
   - Scope change → MAJOR

5. **Update changelog**: Add entry to both frontmatter and inline changelog.

6. **Run inline validation**: Apply `prd-validator` checks to the updated document. Report any remaining issues.

7. **Present**: Show a diff summary of changes + the full updated document.

## Output Contract

- **Format**: Updated Markdown PRD with bumped version
- **Diff summary**: Section-by-section list of changes
- **Validation result**: Inline validation score of the updated document
- **Changelog**: Updated with new entry

## Failure Handling

- Version metadata missing → add it (start at 1.0.0)
- Conflicting changes → ask user to prioritize
- Changes would remove required sections → warn and ask for confirmation
- Post-iteration validation still FAIL → present issues and suggest next iteration

## Safety Boundaries

- Always preserve unchanged sections exactly as-is
- Never silently remove content — track all deletions in changelog
- Confirm with user before MAJOR version bumps
- Do not modify files on disk unless explicitly instructed

## Examples

### Example 1: Fix validator issues

**User**: Update the PRD based on this validator report:
> CRITICAL: US-03 missing acceptance criteria
> WARNING: NFR table missing latency target

**Expected Output**:

Changes summary:
- [FIXED] US-03: Added acceptance criteria "Given... When... Then..."
- [FIXED] NFR table: Added latency target "p95 < 2s"
- Version: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0

Updated PRD with new version header and changelog entry.
